This document describes the output from the Arduino DUE, that is parsed and stored.
There is potentially more data coming from the Arduino, but it is not used at the moment and simply ignored.

Directly parsed into the SQLite database
    Event: sub second micros:SubSeconds; Event Count:x
        Meaning: An event has happened at SubSeconds in this second. Event Count is as continuous counter starting at boot.
    TemperatureC: X;
        Meaning: Current average of all temperature sensors, in Â°C.
    Humidity: X;
        Meaning: Relative humidity in %.
    AccelX: X;
        Meaning: Acceleration in X-direction in m/s^2.
    AccelY: X;
        Meaning: Acceleration in Y-direction in m/s^2.
    AccelZ: X;
        Meaning: Acceleration in Z-direction in m/s^2.
    MagX: X;
        Meaning: Magnetic field in X-direction in Gauss.
    MagY: X;
        Meaning: Magnetic field in X-direction in Gauss.
    MagZ: X;
        Meaning: Magnetic field in X-direction in Gauss.
    Pressure: X;
        Meaning: Pressure in mbar.

Strings starting with '$' are strings coming from the GPS.
From there we extract:
    Longitude
    Latitude
    UTCUnixTime
See the NEMA documentation for more info on these strings: http://aprs.gids.nl/nmea/#gga
